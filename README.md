# PSSI Triage Tool
## Overview

The Post-Secondary Student Stressors Index (PSSI) is a 46-item instrument designed to help post-secondary institutions and researchers with evaluating and surveilling student stress (Linden & Stuart, 2019).
This project is part of a larger study, *Pilot Launch of the Post-Secondary Student Stressors Index (PSSI) as a Student Wellness Services Tool*, which aims to implement the PSSI in clinical settings during the 2025â€“2026 academic year. The tool is currently under development.
